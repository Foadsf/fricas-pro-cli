-- Univariate polynomial solve
solve(x^2 - 5*x + 6 = 0, x)

-- Cubic with rational roots
solve(x^3 - 6*x^2 + 11*x - 6 = 0, x)

-- Simple non-polynomial equation (may return in terms of special functions)
solve(exp(x) = 5, x)

-- Simultaneous linear system in two variables
solve([x + y = 3, 2*x - y = 0], [x, y])

-- Quartic with multiple real roots (robust polynomial solve)
solve(x^4 - 5*x^2 + 4 = 0, x)

-- Parameterized equation (keep it symbolic)
solve(a*x + b = 0, x)
